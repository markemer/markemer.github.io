### About me

Software Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Video Game Nerd, Doctor Who Super-fan, Void-er of Warranties.

My day job for the last decade or so has been Mobile Application Development.

Now with [@ionic-team](https://github.com/ionic-team) working on [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) and friends for [Ionic](https://ionic.io).

Once upon a time, I did iOS Programming for [@CapitalOne](https://github.com/capitalone), and then [@Fundrise](https://github.com/fundrise).

Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away, I built chips for [@IBM](https://github.com/IBM), and handcrafted artisinal transitors at [@RPI](https://github.com/RPI).

#### Open Source

The fine people at [Ionic](https://ionic.io) employ me to make [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor).

I'm also committer/maintainer at [@MacPorts](https://github.com/macports)
