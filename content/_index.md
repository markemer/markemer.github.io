### Mark E. Anderson
Software Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Video Game Nerd, Doctor Who Super-fan, Void-er of Warranties.

My day job for the last decade+ has been Mobile Application Development. 

Now with [@ionic-team](https://github.com/ionic-team) at [@OutSystems](https://github.com/OutSystems) working on [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor) and friends for [Ionic](https://ionic.io) at [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/)

Once upon a time, I did iOS Programming for [@CapitalOne](https://github.com/capitalone), and then [@Fundrise](https://github.com/fundrise). 

Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away, I built chips for [@IBM](https://github.com/IBM), and handcrafted artisinal transitors at [@RPI](https://github.com/RPI).

#### Open Source
The fine people at [Ionic](https://ionic.io) at [OutSystems](https://www.outsystems.com/) employ me to make [Capacitor](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor).

I'm also committer/maintainer at [@MacPorts](https://github.com/macports)
